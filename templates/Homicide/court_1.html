        "<span class='blue-text'>Detective Reid:</span>  It's been two days since Ronald Faraday was convicted for the murder of his wife Becky Faraday, but something about that trial bothers me.", 
        "image about blood trails",
        "<span class='blue-text'>Detective Reid:</span> They brought Officer Hazard in to talk about the missing blood trail photos, something about the camera malfunctioning. According to him, the Blue Star revealed a blood trail from the kitchen, through the hallway, onto the stairs.",
        "<span class='blue-text'>Detective Reid:</span> But if the camera truly wasn't working at the time, why couldn't they wait for a replacement? Why go to court empty handed?",
        "image about slippers",
        "<span class='blue-text'>Detective Reid:</span> Then they brought up Ronald's bloody slippers. Police found them in the closet with the victim's blood on it.",
        "<span class='blue-text'>Detective Reid:</span> Yet there were no footprints to be found, and I doubt he was given enough time to do a thorough cleaning. And how the hell could he get blood on his slippers, but the rest of his clothes remained clean. The same clothes he was in fact wearing when last seen on those gas station cameras.",
        "cuts to Patricia",
        "<span class='blue-text'>Detective Reid:</span> Finally there was the testimony of Becky Faraday's close friend, Patricia Hollinger.",
        "Flashback to Patricia Hollinger's testimony. <br> <span class='green-text'>Prosecution Lawyer Ashley:</span> Ms.Hollinger, you and Becky Faraday were close friends, is that correct?",
        "<span class='red-text'>Patricia Hollinger:</span>  Yes. We became acquainted through work, but became close friends when she was going through chemotherapy. I went to all of her chemo sessions for support. ",
        "<span class='green-text'>Prosecution Lawyer Ashley:</span> You were so close in fact that she ended up signing over her life insurance to you, is that right?",
        "<span class='red-text'>Patricia Hollinger:</span> Absolutely correct. Yes.",
        "<span class='green-text'>Prosecution Lawyer Ashley:</span> Why would she sign over her life insurance to you instead of leaving it with her husband Ronald Faraday?",
        "<span class='red-text'>Patricia Hollinger:</span>  Unfortunately, she often complained about not being completely happy at home. She would fight with Ronald a lot because of his short temper. I would say he is abusive.",
        "<span class='blue-text'>Detective Reid:</span> Now while Ms. Hollinger could have been telling the truth about Ronald and his behavior towards his wife, she also did seem to be making excuses as to why she couldn't use that money to help support Mrs. Faraday's kids. I think she said it's because her mom died recently from Alzheimer's.",
        "<span class='blue-text'>Detective Reid:</span> Something's not right here. Not all of the collected evidence was used, and the ones brought up were dodgy. Also I have a feeling that Patricia Hollinger knows more than she's letting on. I should get in contact with Ronald's lawyer, he might have more info on what's happened with his client's case.",
        "Almost as if Lawyer Schultz could hear Detective Reid's thoughts, Detective Reid recieves an email from Lawyer Schultz with a file attached titled: Something witty please help."
